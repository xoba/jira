simple command-line interface for jira
--------------------------------------

useful in its own right to avoid manually visiting jira website, or
for use in git hooks, etc...

you could put exports like these into your ~/.bashrc file for convenience:

  export JIRA_USERNAME=joe.smith
  export JIRA_PASSWORD=abc123
  export JIRA_URL=http://www.example.com/jira
